Connections for the Tank Full Alerting System:


Water Level Sensor:
VCC pin: Connect to 5V on the Arduino.
GND pin: Connect to GND on the Arduino.
Signal pin (Analog output): Connect to A0 on the Arduino (this is the pin defined in the code).

Buzzer:
Positive pin (longer leg): Connect to pin 8 on the Arduino (or the pin you choose).
Negative pin (shorter leg): Connect to GND on the Arduino.

LED (Built-in on Pin 13):
If you want to use the built-in LED on Pin 13, no external wiring is needed since it is already available on most Arduino boards (like the Arduino Uno).
If you're using an external LED:
Anode (longer leg): Connect to pin 13 on the Arduino.
Cathode (shorter leg): Connect to GND via a 220Î© resistor (optional for current limiting).
